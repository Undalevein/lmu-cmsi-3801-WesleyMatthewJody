This repo is a collection of submitted homework from the group. Under the README.md is a description of every homework assignment.

### Homework Descriptions
+ **Homework 1 (Scripting)**: Lua, Python, JavaScript
    + First then Lower Case: A function that is given a sequence of strings *a* and a predicate *p* and returns the lowercase version of the first element of *a* that satisfies *p*, returning nil, undefined, or None for each respective language if none can be found.
    + Powers Generator: A generator function or coroutine that yields successive powers of base *b* starting at 0, stopping before the result exceeds the given limit.
    + Say: A "chainable" function that accepts one string per call and when it is called without arguments, it returns all of the previously passed words in order separated by a space.
    + Meaningful Line Count: A function that takes in a filename and returns the number of text lines that are not empty, made up entirely of whitespace, or whose first non whitespace character is #.
    + Quaternion: A class or table that functions as a Quaternion and is able to construct, add, multiply, obtain the list of coefficients, compute the conjugate, support value-based equality, and produce the string representation.
